Building reliable onchain applications requires comprehensive testing. OnchainTestKit is a type-safe framework designed specifically for testing blockchain applications built with OnchainKit, providing seamless integration with Playwright for browser automation and wallet interactions.

## What is OnchainTestKit?

[OnchainTestKit](https://github.com/coinbase/onchaintestkit) is an end-to-end testing framework that automates:

- Wallet connections (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
- Transaction flows and approvals
- Network switching
- Smart contract interactions
- Token swaps and minting
- Gas sponsorship testing

## Why Use OnchainTestKit?

Testing blockchain applications manually is time-consuming and error-prone. OnchainTestKit provides:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with compile-time error checking
- **Wallet Automation**: Programmatic control over wallet interactions
- **Parallel Testing**: Run multiple tests simultaneously with isolated environments
- **Network Management**: Built-in support for local Anvil nodes and fork testing
- **OnchainKit Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with OnchainKit components
