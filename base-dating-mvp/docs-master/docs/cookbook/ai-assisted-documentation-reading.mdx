# Techniques for understanding documentation

AI tools excel at breaking down complex technical content into understandable explanations and practical guidance tailored to your specific learning needs and project requirements. Below are three techniques that you can use to leverage AI to help you understand documentation.

### Used tailored prompts

The "Explain Like I'm a Vibe Coder" approach involves asking AI to simplify technical concepts while maintaining practical applicability. This technique is particularly effective for understanding blockchain concepts, API documentation, and complex development patterns. The key is providing context about your current knowledge level and specific goals rather than asking for generic explanations.

```
I'm looking at this API documentation but finding it confusing. 
I want to implement the `Checkout` component on the checkout.tsx page of my website. 
Please explain this like I'm a Vibe Coder (someone new to blockchain development but familiar with basic web development):
```

```typescript Checkout.tsx
const chargeHandler = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/createCharge', { method: 'POST' });
  const { id } = await response.json();
  return id; // Return charge ID
};

<Checkout chargeHandler={chargeHandler}>
  <CheckoutButton />
</Checkout>;
```

</Accordion>

### Use Screenshots

Sharing a screenshot with AI enhances its ability to understand your problem significantly. When you encounter confusing documentation sections, interfaces, or error messages, including screenshots in your AI prompts provides visual context that pure text cannot convey. Most AI tools can analyze images and provide specific guidance based on what they observe in your screenshots.

I'm looking at this API documentation but finding it confusing. I want to implement the `Checkout` component on the checkout.tsx page of my website.

I have attached two screenshots. The first screenshot is the page I would like to implement the `Checkout` component on. The second screenshot is the API documentation I am looking at.

### Use code snippets

Code snippet analysis is another powerful technique. When you find example code in documentation but don't understand how it applies to your situation, you can paste the code into an AI prompt along with your specific requirements. The AI can explain the code's purpose, modify it for your needs, and highlight potential issues or improvements.

Specifically help me understand:

1. What this API does in simple terms
2. When I would use it in my Mini App
3. What the key parameters mean
4. A practical example with my specific use case: [DESCRIBE YOUR USE CASE]

Break it down step-by-step and include a working code example I can copy and modify.
