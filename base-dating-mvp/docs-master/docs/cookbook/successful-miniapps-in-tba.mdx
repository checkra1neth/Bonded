# Optimizing for Base App Success

Mini Apps succeed when they create the smoothest possible user experience. **MiniKit**, powered by **Base Account**, lets people use your app without having to sign in or build a separate "connect wallet" flow. It makes interacting with your app feel snappy and familiar. **Paymaster** removes first-time friction by covering gas so users can act right away. **Batched transactions** reduce pop-ups and approvals to a single, clear confirmation. Together, these components make Mini Apps feel cohesive and keep quality high across the Base ecosystem.

| Component            | Optimization Strategy             | Implementation Focus                  | Success Metrics              |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| Smart Accounts       | Leverage universal wallet support | Design simplified onboarding flows    | User conversion rates        |
| OnchainKit           | Import proven components          | Customize for specific use cases      | Development velocity         |
| Paymaster (Gasless)  | Strategic transaction sponsorship | Optimize cost vs. experience balance  | User engagement rates        |
| Batched Transactions | Reduce interaction complexity     | Bundle related operations efficiently | Transaction completion rates |

<Steps>
  <Step title='Audit Connect Walet touchpoints'>
    If you are using a custom wallet connection flow, you can replace it with
    MiniKit + Base Account.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Adopt OnchainKit where it fits'>
    Evaluate which OnchainKit components can replace custom implementations to
    align with Base UI patterns and speed up development.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Implement Paymaster'>
    If you app requires a user to mint a NFT or submit a transaction onchain,
    ensure it is gasless by making that component interact with a Paymaster.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Use Batched Transactions'>
    If you are using doing multiple transactions in a row, you can use batched
    transactions to reduce the number of popups and approvals.
  </Step>

Below is a prompt that will help you optimize your Mini App for maximum success in the Base App ecosystem.

```
Help me optimize my Mini App for maximum success in the Base App ecosystem:

CURRENT APP ANALYSIS:

- App type: [DESCRIBE YOUR MINI APP]
- Current user journey: [OUTLINE KEY USER STEPS]
- Main friction points: [IDENTIFY USER EXPERIENCE ISSUES]
- Target metrics: [DEFINE SUCCESS MEASUREMENTS]

SMART ACCOUNT OPTIMIZATION:

- Simplify user onboarding to leverage universal wallet support
- Remove unnecessary wallet complexity from user flows
- Design authentication that feels like traditional app login
- Optimize for users who don't understand blockchain concepts

ONCHAINKIT INTEGRATION:

- Identify which custom components can be replaced with OnchainKit
- Optimize component customization for brand consistency
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all components

PAYMASTER STRATEGY:

- Analyze which transactions should be sponsored for maximum impact
- Calculate sustainable sponsorship budget based on user volume
- Implement intelligent sponsorship rules and fallback options
- Design user communication about gasless benefits

BATCHED TRANSACTION OPTIMIZATION:

- Identify operations that can be combined for better UX
- Design single-signature flows for complex operations
- Handle partial failures and edge cases gracefully
- Optimize gas efficiency while maintaining reliability

Provide specific implementation recommendations with code examples and measurable optimization targets for each component.
