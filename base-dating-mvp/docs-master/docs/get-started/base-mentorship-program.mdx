## Program Purpose

The Base Mentorship Program connects builders with top operators and investors who have been there before, sharing lessons learned, making introductions, and helping you avoid costly mistakes. Mentors work closely with the Base team to ensure their advice is actionable and aligned with your stage and goals.

## Base Mentors

Base Mentors are experienced founders, operators, and subject matter experts across key verticals who volunteer their time to support builders in the Base ecosystem. They offer guidance on topics like product strategy, go-to-market, technical architecture, growth, fundraising, and more. We work directly with builders to pair them with the right mentor for their needs.
