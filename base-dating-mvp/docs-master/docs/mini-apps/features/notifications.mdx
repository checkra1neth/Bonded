<Info>
Notifications are not yet available in Base App but are planned for a future release.
</Info>

Push notifications will allow you to re-engage users who have saved your Mini App, driving retention and bringing users back at key moments like new content releases, achievements, or time-sensitive events.

When available, notifications will be rate-limited and only sent to users who have explicitly saved your Mini App to their collection.
