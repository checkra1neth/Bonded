title: "Why Mini Apps"
description: "Discover how Mini Apps eliminate  friction and leverage social distribution to create instantly engaging, viral experiences that traditional apps can't match."
---

The next evolution of digital experiences extends beyond app stores into social feeds and direct messages. Mini Apps are lightweight, social-native apps that launch instantly when you tap them: no downloads, no friction, just immediate engagement. While the Base App provides the discoverability through social distribution and featured listings, Mini Apps deliver the frictionless experience that makes instant trial and viral sharing possible.

<Note>
Existing web applications can be converted into Mini Apps. Learn how to [integrate your existing app](/mini-apps/quickstart/existing-apps/install) with our helpful guide.

<Tip>
 **Framework Compatibility Note**
Mini apps built with either the [Farcaster SDK](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/) or MiniKit both work seamlessly in the Base app. Choose the framework that best fits your development preferences
</Tip>

## Beyond the App Store Model

Traditional apps face costly user acquisition because they're buried among millions of competitors in app stores, require separate iOS and Android development with ongoing maintenance across platforms, and create commitment friction through installation requirements. Mini Apps eliminate these barriers entirely by running as lightweight web applications that work instantly across all devices, deploy with zero installation friction, and spread organically through social feeds where users naturally discover content—turning every interaction into potential viral distribution that no app store algorithm can match.

## What Makes Mini Apps Different

### For Users: Frictionless Discovery and Engagement

Mini Apps eliminate the gap between discovery and engagement. Instead of downloading apps you might never use again, you can instantly try interactive experiences shared by friends. With leaderboards, challenges, and multiplayer features, these apps transform from individual experiences into social activities you do with your friends—competing, collaborating, and sharing achievements together.

### For Builders: Built-in Social Infrastructure

As a developer, you build on top of existing social infrastructure instead of recreating it from scratch.

**What you get out of the box:**
- User identity and authentication
- Social connections and friend graphs
- Viral distribution mechanisms
- Immediate access to engaged communities




## The Builder's Advantage

Mini Apps solve three major product development challenges:

</Frame>

<AccordionGroup

<Accordion title="Discovery Challenge" defaultOpen="true" >
  **Traditional Apps:** Builders pay for ads and fight algorithms for visibility
  
  **Mini Apps Solution:** User activity appears organically in their social feed (followers, friends, connections), naturally inviting others through social proof via sharing.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Frame caption="User Acquisition">

</Frame>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="User Acquisition Challenge" defaultOpen="true">
  **Traditional Apps:** Expensive campaigns with low conversion rates.
  
  **Mini Apps Solution:** Every interaction becomes viral distribution. Users broadcast engagement to their entire network, creating compound growth loops that traditional apps can't achieve.

</Frame>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Engagement Challenge" defaultOpen="true">
  **Traditional Apps:** Users start alone and build social graphs slowly.
  
  **Mini Apps Solution:** Launch directly into existing friend groups, see live activity from friends, and join conversations already in progress.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>



## The Network Effect Advantage

</Frame>

As more people interact with these apps, they create valuable user activity and market opportunities that attract talented builders to Base, who see the engaged audience and build even better, more innovative experiences to capture that demand.This self-reinforcing cycle means every successful app strengthens the entire network, creating exponential growth that benefits every builder on Base.

## From Idea to Live Application

The development path is streamlined and permissionless:

<Steps>
<Step title="Build your Mini App">
  Use [MiniKit](/mini-apps/quickstart/new-apps/install) or the [Farcaster SDK](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/getting-started) to create your application.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy directly">
  Deploy your Mini App without waiting for approval processes or store reviews.
</Step>

<Step title="Get discovered automatically">
  Post your Mini App to Base App and it gets automatically indexed for discovery.  No special permissions or approval processes required to show up in the Base App.
  
  Your app becomes instantly discoverable in:
  - Base App search results
  - The broader Farcaster ecosystem
  - User social feeds through organic sharing
  
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate based on real usage">
  Monitor actual usage patterns and iterate based on real user feedback rather than building in isolation.
</Step>
</Steps>
