## Why agents?

Messaging is the largest use-case in the world, but it's more than just conversations—it's a secure, programmable channel for financial and social innovation. When combined with the onchain capabilities of Base App, builders have a new surface area to build 10X better messaging experiences not currently possible on legacy platforms like WhatsApp or Messenger.

Real Examples:

• Smart Payment Assistant: Text "split dinner $200 4 ways" and everyone gets paid instantly with sub-cent fees, no app switching or Venmo delays.

• AI Trading Companion: Message "buy $100 ETH when it hits $3,000" and your agent executes trades 24/7 while you sleep.

• Travel Planning Agent: "Book flight LAX to NYC under $300" and get instant booking with crypto payments, all in your group chat

• Base App & XMTP are combining AI, crypto, and mini apps with secure messaging – to unlock use-cases never before possible. Secure group chats & DMs are the new surface area for developers.
